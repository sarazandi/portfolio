Hi George,

I have 2 jQuery which one I've used for my menu and the other has been used for my title.
If you click on hamburger, my menu slid in and in mobile version my social media icons are removed from homepage and come to menu. ( you'll find out when you resize the screen any way).

I haven't used percentages for my hexagons as become really small in mobile size and instead, I designed my structure change base on different devices; On the other word, I kept my hexagon the same size but in each device you will see different design.

for all other margin, fonts and positioning I have used em or %.

Hope I didn't confused you too much
